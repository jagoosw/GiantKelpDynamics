# GiantKelpDynamics

A coupled model for the motion (and in the future growth and biogeochemical interactions) of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).
Based on the models proposed by [Utter1996](@citet) and [Rosman2013](@citet), and used in [StrongWright2023](@citet).
Implemented in the framework of OceanBioME.jl[StrongWright2023](@citep) and the coupled with the fluid dynamics of Oceananigans.jl[Ramadhan2020](@citep).
